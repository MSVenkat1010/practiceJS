## Naming variables

### When it comes to naming variables, there are some conventions in place:

- Variables start with a lowercase letter, and they should be descriptive. If something holds an age, do not call it x, but age. This way, when you read your script later, you can easily understand what you did by just reading your code.
- Variables cannot contain spaces, but they can use underscores. If you use a space, JavaScript doesn't recognize it as a single variable.
