## Practice exercise 1.1 - <font color="red">DONE</font>

1. Open the browser console, type 4 + 10, and press Enter. What do you see as the response?
2. Use the console.log() syntax, placing a value within the rounded brackets. Try entering your name with quotes around it (this is to indicate the fact that it's a text stringâ€”we'll get to this in the next chapter).
