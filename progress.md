# Using the browser console

## Practice exercise 1.1 - $\color{#1FB42A}{DONE}$
### Working with the console:
1. Open the browser console, type 4 + 10, and press Enter. What do you see as the response?
2. Use the console.log() syntax, placing a value within the rounded brackets. Try entering your name with quotes around it (this is to indicate the fact that it's a text stringâ€”we'll get to this in the next chapter).

### JavaScript in an HTML page:
1. Open your code editor and create an HTML file.
2. Within your HTML file, set up the HTML tags, doctype, HTML, head, and body, and then proceed and add the script tags.
3. Place some JavaScript code within the script tags. You can use console. log("hello world!").

### Linking to a JS JavaScript file:
 Chapter 1
1. Create a separate file called app with the extension .js.
2. Within the .js file, add some JavaScript code.
3. Link to the separate .js file within the HTML file you created in Practice exercise 1.2.
4. Open the HTML file within your browser and check to see whether the JavaScript code ran properly.

## Practice exercise 1.4 - $\color{#1FB42A}{DONE}$

1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value. Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line:
let a = 10;
2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of
10.
3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this will do.
4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the purpose of the file.
